  the internet connection.

* User Access setup per repository based around SME Server users and groups
  while also allowing Anonymous access.

* Automatic email notification configuration for Git repository updates based
  on the combined PULL & PUSH User Access list.
* All Git repository creation and user access setup through SME server-manager panel.

  repository names don't confict with ibay names or other accounts on SME Server.

  repository viewers e.g. Redmine.
* Optionally install the gitweb viewer for the git repositories.
