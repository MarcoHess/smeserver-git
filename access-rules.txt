This document documents the various access rules and how they are supposed to work:

configuration database:

  status           :  [enabled|diabled]
  description      :  text
  allow_access_from:  [local|internet]

git database:

  entry name       :  name of git repository without the .git extension
  type             :  repository
  description      :  text
  pull_groups      :  comma separated list of groups with pull permissions
  pull_users       :  comma separated list of users with pull permissions
  push_groups      :  comma separated list of groups with push permissions
  push_users       :  comma separated list of users with push permissions

The system collects an effective list of users from combining the groups and
users. If the effective list of users is empty, access is allowed as Anonymous.

Example:

# db git show smeserver-git
smeserver-git=repository
    allow_access_from=internet
    description=SME Server GIT Integration
    pull_groups=
    pull_users=
    push_groups=staff
    push_users=


Allow Access From
=================
- Select from local & internet

Pull Users
==========
- Users that have read access to the repository
- When there are no users selected for read access the access is anonymous

Push Users
==========
- Users that have write access to the repository
- When there are no users selected for write access the access is anonymous?
