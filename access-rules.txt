This document documents the various access rules and how they are supposed to work:

configuration database:

  status           :  [enabled|diabled]
  description      :  text
  allow_access_from:  [local|internet]

git database:

  type             :  repository
  description      :  text
  pull_groups      :  comma separated list of groups with pull permissions
  pull_users       :  comma separated list of users with pull permissions
  push_groups      :  comma separated list of groups with push permissions
  push_users       :  comma separated list of users with push permissions

The system collects an effective list of users from combining the groups and
users. If the effective list of users, access is allowed as Anonymous.
